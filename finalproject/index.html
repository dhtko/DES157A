                            <p>In South Korea, military service is mandatory, and every man (starting at age 18 or above) must be enlisted. I enlisted in the army in June 2021 and completed my service in December 2022. The picture was taken on the morning of the day of joining the army. Notice how my hair is short due to requirements that trainees should have before being enlisted. After I enlisted, I went through a trainee session, and it was fast; there were numerous exercises and simulations that I could not remember all. The session was tough, but it was an important step to becoming a soldier who can protect my country.</p>

                            <p>After I finished my training session, I got promoted to private rank and was assigned to my unit (11th Company, 1st Platoon, 3rd Squad). When I entered the dormitory, the members welcomed me with surprise firecrackers. It was surprising because I expected the unit to have a strict, rigid environment. However, it was the opposite, as the picture shows. The picture was taken during my welcome party, where Lieutenant Lim delivered fried chicken to the platoon. In addition, it was Friday night during the Olympic (Tokyo 2021) season, so it was the perfect time for chicken. <br>*Try to find me, if you can.</p>

                                    During my service as a private 1st class rank (promoted from private rank), there were numerous drills and teamwork training. During that time, the platoon members were regularly switched as Sergeant members were discharged and private members were assigned to the platoon. This change allowed me to have deep conversations with comrades and build private relationships with them.<br>
                                    <br>Although I was not able to take photos during drills (confidential information), I collected the photos taken during the teamwork training, like barbeque time, sports day, and late-night activities (i.e. mafia game).<br>

                        <p id="corporalText">
                            The military experience during corporal rank was peaceful: no drills, training, or any external work. Hence, I was able to reflect on myself and enjoy being a part of a community with strong teamwork. During this time, I went to the trip with the comrades who joined the army in the same month, known as the "Members of June." We went on the trip to celebrate our first year of military service, and the whole experience was wild and young: no planning, no thinking, just drinking and being young. It was truly remarkable and I would never forget such experience.
