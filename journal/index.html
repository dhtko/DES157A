                <br>The assigned article discusses 20 best practices that increase the usability of an online form. This article was a pleasure to read because the author revealed all the design choices users normally perceive as ‘natural.’ Normally, users, including myself, treat online forms as a tedious process that needs to be done as quickly as possible. Hence, it is common to accept all the design choices on the form as characteristics of online forms ‘should’ have.<br><br>However, from the article, I learned a lesson that a designer should always remember: what we perceive as “normal” are the collections of the UX design thinking processes. For example, forms position a label on the top-left of the input field because such design choices make the users read the label and input field simultaneously, resulting in lowering the number of eye fixations and fastening the completion time. In addition, the explanation of collecting sensitive information is also a design choice that keeps the users from completing the form because without an explanation, collecting such information can disturb the users enough to abandon the form.<br><br>To conclude, the article itself was simple: 20 practices that should be done when forming an online form. However, it taught me more than just design practices: it helped me to understand the design choices on everyday objects like online forms.

                <br>Out of the numerous websites that I experienced, the account setup for <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/join/?&snr=1_60_4__62">Steam</a> was the website that exemplifies the best practices because it maintained a single-column format, minimal input fields, and top-left label placement.
