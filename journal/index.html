            <p>
                <br>The article I read is "Overuse of Overlays" by the Nielson Norman Group because I wanted to know more about overlay as a design element and "correct" practices of the design element. This article would be valuable to the MadLibs project since I am new to overlay and I plan to incorporate an overlay element for my MadLib project.<br>
                <br>One important practice when using an overlay is applying the correct visibility on the background. Normally, an overlay would decrease the visibility on the background to ensure the user focuses on the overlay. However, some overlays incorporate higher visibility in the background to ensure the users have the context in mind. Therefore, I have to understand what my users want to do before applying an overlay.<br>
                <br>Another important practice that I learned when applying an overlay is the control of the overlay. Throughout the reading, the author constantly mentioned that it is important to allow users to leave the overlay in various ways because after all, an overlay is a pop-up that disturbs the workflow. Without a designated exit/cancel button (escape or back also works), an overlay fails as a design element. Thus, I have to add a dedicated 'go back' button on the overlay.<br> 
                <br>In conclusion, I earned a deeper understanding of the overlays and how to correctly apply the design choice in my MadLib project.

            <h3><br>Assigned Article: <a href = "https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"><em>Best Practices for Form Design</em></a></h3>
            
            <p>
                <br>The assigned article discusses 20 best practices that increase the usability of an online form. This article was a pleasure to read because the author revealed all the design choices users normally perceive as ‘natural.’ Normally, users, including myself, treat online forms as a tedious process that needs to be done as quickly as possible. Hence, it is common to accept all the design choices on the form as characteristics of online forms ‘should’ have.<br><br>However, from the article, I learned a lesson that a designer should always remember: what we perceive as “normal” are the collections of the UX design thinking processes. For example, forms position a label on the top-left of the input field because such design choices make the users read the label and input field simultaneously, resulting in lowering the number of eye fixations and fastening the completion time. In addition, the explanation of collecting sensitive information is also a design choice that keeps the users from completing the form because without an explanation, collecting such information can disturb the users enough to abandon the form.<br><br>To conclude, the article itself was simple: 20 practices that should be done when forming an online form. However, it taught me more than just design practices: it helped me to understand the design choices on everyday objects like online forms.

                <br>Out of the numerous websites that I experienced, the <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/join/?&snr=1_60_4__62"><em>account setup for Steam</em></a> was the website that exemplifies the best practices because it maintained a single-column format, minimal input fields, and top-left label placement.
