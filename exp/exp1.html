    <h1>Experiment 1</h1>
    <h2>Right click on any part of the display, then click inspect. Once random stuff pops up, click the 'console' menu to check the JS experiment that I worked.</h2>
    <p>Experiment: Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</p>

        for (var i = 1; i < 101; i++){

Then, I need to add another condition when i divided by 3 is not equal to zero. To do so, I used && bolean expression to only print buzz when both conditions are True.*/
