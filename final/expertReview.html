            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The usability test for expert review and report used the prototype of the final project (applied the feedback received from the Final Project Visualization Process) because I wanted to take the expert review as a feedback session that led to the final iteration of the project. Therefore, the findings may be underwhelming.</p>

                <h3>Summary of Key Findings</h3>
                <p>After observing the movements of the two test users, I found the key findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The user tried to click the arrow buttons when the overlay content was enabled. They clicked multiple times, even though they were disabled
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user tried to click the "previous" arrow button when the user reached the opening chapter, and the "next" arrow button when the user reached the closing chapter.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Who You Test With</h3>
                <p>
                    The test users who participated in the usability test were Sam and Tom. Sam is the class undergrad design tutor of the class, and Tom is my roommate, who does not have any design-related knowledge. I selected these two people for the users because I wanted to test out the user’s behavior, who pays full attention to every aspect of the project (Sam), and the user’s behavior, who prioritizes the overall experience (Tom). Since the project’s target audience is ‘anyone who visited the project,’ I believe the selected users are eligible candidates of the test users. In addition, the test users have different perspectives on the task, so this difference will make the project more adaptable to a wide range of audience.

                <h3>What the Tasks Were</h3>
                <p>
                    The task that the users went through was simple: I introduced the project without prior knowledge (theme, instruction on navigation, etc.) and let the users go through the entire project (from beginning to end). While the user interacts with the project, I take notes of their movements, like which button they clicked first, which photo they interacted with first, how the cursor moved throughout the interaction, and much more. Once the user reaches the end, I ask the test users about any pain points, confusion, or possible improvements they want from the next iteration.

                <h3>Usability Problems</h3>
                <p>Through the usability tests, I was able to find the following usability problems:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./images/openingProblem.jpg" alt="openingProblem">
                        The users tried to click the ‘previous’ arrow button when they were in the beginning chapter and the ‘next’ button when the users were in the last chapter of the project. I think this happened because the hover text states that clicking to move to the next or previous chapter can be applied to the opening and closing chapters as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./images/overlayProblem.jpg" alt="overlayProblem">
                        Like the first problem, the users tried to click the ‘previous’ arrow and the ‘next’ button when the users interacted with the overlay contents. I think this happened because the hover text states that clicking to move to the next or previous ‘chapter’ can be applied to the overlay contents as well. One critical action that I spotted is that the users clicked the buttons even though it was disabled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="./images/bottomTextProblem.jpg" alt="bottomTextProblem">
                        In the opening chapter, the users tried to click the text at the bottom of the content. According to the user, the user clicked because it was in a different color than the title, so the user expected something different.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Other Feedback</h3>
                <p>Although these are not considered as usability problems, I think these are worthy of mentioning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The users did not use the previous arrow button during the test</li>
                    <li>The cursor mainly navigated around the right edge of the content to quickly click the next arrow button</li>
                    <li>In the sergeant chapter, the user started to explore the chapter with the overlay located on the right side. Then, they interacted with the other overlay contents in a counterclockwise direction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thankfully, I was not able to capture any bugs during the tests. Moreover, Bill and Abrar suggested to add more features on the final project since the change compare to the intial submission looks minimal.</p>
