                For the final project, I decided to work on Every Picture Project because it could have been much better if I had more time.<br>
                <br>Within the three categories (functionality, design, and UX/UI), I plan to focus on UX/UI because I noticed some common feedback that addresses UX/UI in peer reviews. Also, I only focused on the functionality of the project on the first attempt. Therefore, I plan to focus on usability to address the feedback and improve the quality of the project. To tackle such an issue, I plan to start from the sketch: starting by summarizing the peer feedback (including the one from the small group session as well), highlighting the common problems, and iterating the sketch based on the common problems. The iteration can be simple, like adding an emphasis on instructions, or complex, like rebuilding an entire section.<br>
                <br>In addition, I am thinking of including additional visual elements into the project to enhance the user experience of the project. The primary objective of the project is to "deliver my experience during military service to users through the collection of photos." While I did deliver my experience, it was not immersive enough; it feels like a presentation rather than a movie credit that reviews the experience. As much as I spent most of my effort on the functionality of the project, I missed the primary purpose of the project. To solve such a problem, I am planning to add background images that adapt to sections to bring an immersive experience and create animations and interactions to add depth to the immersive experience. <br><em>FYI, I AM NOT SURE IF I WILL WORK ON IT OR NOT AND WHETHER THE PLAN IS CONSIDERED AS A UX/UI SECTION. IF THE PLAN IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO THE VISUAL DESIGN CATEGORY, THEN I MIGHT EXCLUDE THIS PLAN.</em><br>
                
                <br>In terms of expert feedback, I am planning to get feedback from Sam and my roommate, Tom. I put Tom on the list because I think that a non-design person can catch subtle details and UI errors that a designer can miss. Most of my design learnings came from the unexpected feedback from people who have zero background in design.
